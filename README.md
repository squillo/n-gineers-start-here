### What is N Lang?
[N Lang](https://github.com/squillo/n) is the world's first network service language â€” a unique blend of orchestration, configuration, and programming. N Lang provides a construct for writing sub-dividable programs that are highly distributable.

### Why create a new language?
First, we wanted to maximize speed, reliability, and maintainability for networked services. Next, we needed to create a way to directly express the relationship between networked data and services and how we could program that directly.

### Is N Lang hard to learn?
Subjectively no. It's a new mindset to learn, but it is specifically human-readable and is often familiar. It's designed around the concept that small simple systems make complex systems work. To do this, the language uses blocks and attributes to compose large systems from small systems.

### Why would I use N Lang?
If you are already using a process like Infrastructure as Code, then you already know the advantages of configuration & orchestration repeatability coupled with version control for infrastructure. N Lang is the missing utility that extends those capabilities into service creation, integration, and recombination.

### What would I use N Lang for?
N Lang is specifically designed for highly productive service creation, integration, and recombination that scales. It's specifically well suited to create, connect, and transform data while handling change and the faulty nature of networks.

### What is an N-gineer?
An N-gineer is someone that writes N Lang programs. We use a special name for them because N Lang programming is a combination of so many disciplines.  

### What is an N Lang program?
N Lang programs are interpreted programs written in N Lang that create, connect, and recombine services.

### How do I learn to write an N Lang program?
The best way to learn is by starting with the [N Lang Tutorial Series](https://github.com/squillo/n_tutorials). You could also learn all the ins and outs of N Lang by referring to the [N Lang Specification](https://github.com/squillo/n). 

### Is N Lang extendable? 
N Lang is also extendable, which means that certain N Lang parsers and interpreters may have pre-written N Lang blocks that add common functionality. For example, Squillo's [Raconteur](https://github.com/squillo/raconteur) is equipped with definitions for advanced CQRS, Cron Jobs, an Event bus, Webhooks, and more.  

### Can I develop my own N Lang blocks?
Yes (eventually), since N Lang is a construct for sub-dividable programs, block definitions can be created and then supported by an N Lang interpreter.

### How do I develop my N Lang program?
The best way to develop an N Lang program is using the [Squillo NDE](https://github.com/squillo/squillo-nde) and then parse your program for an N Lang interpreter. However, any UTF-8 encoding editor is suitable. We denote N documents with a `.n` file extension.

### How do I parse N for an Interpreter?
Eventually, there will be several options for parsing N Lang programs. In the meantime, Squillo developed the [Raconteur Parser](https://github.com/squillo/raconteur) for N Lang programs. You can use the [Raconteur-cli](https://github.com/squillo/raconteur-cli) or Squillo NDE to parse your N Lang program for an N Lang interpreter.

### How do I interpret my parsed N Lang program?
Eventually, there will be several options to interpret parsed N Lang programs, in the mean time Squillo developed Raconteur Object Interpreters (ROIs) for the Raconteur N Lang parser. Currently, there is the [ROI: Elixir](https://github.com/squillo/ex_raconteur_umbrella) written in Elixir. 

### How do I deploy my N Lang program as an application?
Once you've parsed your N Lang program and selected your interpreter. You can deploy your N Lang application typically using a Docker Image of your Interpreter with your program as a volume.

### How do N Lang applications communicate?
All N Lang applications use the N Lang Message Wire Protocol (MWP) to send and receive messages. Messages tell the N Lang application what part of a program to run and with what data. By default, a message request and response is a synchronous operation.

### How do I message my N Lang application?
 Depending on your N Lang Interpreter, you can send messages over an N Gateway. Eventually, there will be several N Gateway options, in the meantime, Squillo developed a [Kong Gateway plugin](https://github.com/squillo/rcp-gateway-kong) that converts HTTP requests to and from the N Lang Message Wire Protocol. This N Gateway is designed to work as a standalone plugin with Kong but also works with the Raconteur Control Plane (RCP) "TODO LINK NEEDED" developed by Squillo.  

### Can I write my own N Lang parser?
Yes, as long as it follows the N Lang specification and is registered as an N Lang parser.
Check the [N Lang parser registry](https://github.com/squillo/n/blob/main/N%20Language%20Spec/N_LANGUAGE_PARSER_REGISTRY.md) to get started.

### Can I write my own N Lang interpreter?
Yes, as long as it follows the N Lang specification and is registered as an N Lang interpreter. Check the [N Lang interpreter registry](https://github.com/squillo/n/blob/main/N%20Language%20Spec/N_LANGUAGE_INTERPRETERS_REGISTRY.md) to get started.

### Can I write my own N Lang gateway
Yes, as long as it follows the N Lang specification and is registered as an N Lang gateway. Check the [N Lang gateway registry](https://github.com/squillo/n/blob/main/N%20Language%20Spec/N_LANGUAGE_GATEWAYS_REGISTRY.md) to get started.

### Can I write my own N Lang blocks?
Yes, however, the N Lang parser and interpreter you select will need to support your custom block type.
Check the [N Lang block specification]() to get started.
